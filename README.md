# Dot Painting with Turtle

## Full Description

This Dot Painting project leverages Python's Turtle graphics module to create a piece of digital art reminiscent of pointillism. The program uses a predefined palette of colors, randomly selecting from these to draw a grid of dots. The result is a vibrant, abstract artwork that can be customized in terms of dot size, spacing, and color palette.

**Features:**
- **Random Color Selection:** The script selects random colors from a custom color list, creating a dynamic and varied painting each time the script is run.
- **Grid Layout:** Dots are placed in a structured grid pattern, with customizable spacing between them.
- **Turtle Graphics:** Utilizes the Turtle module's capabilities to draw on the screen with a high degree of control over movement and drawing.

**Note**: This project was inspired by Angela Yu's course on Udemy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The Turtle graphics module (usually included with Python installations).

### How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python dot_painting.py
   ```

3. Watch as the turtle creates a colorful dot painting on the screen, placing dots in a grid pattern with random colors.

### Customization

You can customize the Dot Painting by:
- **Changing Colors:** Modify the `color_list` to include different colors extracted from images or handpicked.
- **Adjusting Dot Size and Spacing:** Change the size of the dots or the distance between them by adjusting the parameters in the script.
- **Grid Dimensions:** Alter the number of dots or the grid's dimensions to create larger or smaller artworks.
